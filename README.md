*Test task: Financial transactions system* 

**Only business logic code required. MVC pattern is forbidden, UI Interface is not required because there is no reason for start application. That means you should not write controllers and views.** 

***Task Question:*** 

Implement a set of classes for managing the financial operations of an account. 

There are three types of transactions: deposits, withdrawals and transfer from account to account. 

The transaction contains a comment, an amount, and a due date. 

Required methods: 

- get all accounts in the system. 
- get the balance of a specific account 
- perform an operation 
- get all account transactions sorted by comment in alphabetical order.
